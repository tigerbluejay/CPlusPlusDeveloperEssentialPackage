## Introduction to Computer Science I (Georgetown University - Summer 2016)

This repository contains a capstone project from Introduction to Computer Science I (Georgetown University, Summer 2016), designed as a structured and hands-on journey through C++ fundamentals. The project is divided into four standalone console applications (referred to here as Projects 1â€“4), each building upon the previous one in complexity and sophistication. It starts with basic concepts like data types, control structures, and input/output, and progresses to more advanced topics, including user-defined functions, object-oriented programming, operator overloading, and code optimization.

Throughout the projects, students develop an application that processes and analyzes manufacturing orders for cones and frustums, incorporating user input validation, geometric calculations, and cost analysis. By working through these stages, learners gain practical experience with essential software engineering principles such as encapsulation, modular design, and use of vectors and classes. Whether you are a beginner looking to solidify your C++ skills or seeking a cohesive project that ties fundamental concepts into a full application, this repository offers a complete, real-world coding experience.


This repository contains four C++ projects (and sample pseudocode for one of them).

### Project 1 and Project 1 Pseudocode files cover:
basic data types, the C++ string class, variables and constants, input/output (cin/cout) operators,
assignment operators, arithmetic operators, conditional control structures

### Project 2 files cover:
Topics in Project 1 + repetition control structures, basic file operations

### Project 3 files cover:
Topics in Projects 1-2 + user-defined functions, value and reference parameters,
elementary software engineering principles,  the vector class,

### Project 4 files cover:
Topics in Projects 1-4, constructor, function and operator overloading, accessors, mutators, code optimization
